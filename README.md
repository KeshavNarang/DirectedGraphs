# DirectedGraphs
Directed Graphs are immensely useful models for organizational systems, and we would like to know whether, and how, various nodes are related to each other in such visualizations. The depth-first-search and breadth-first-search algorithm serve as mechanisms to explore these relationships, and ultimately determine strongly connected components (the maximal subset of nodes among whom there is always a path from one node to the other), as demostrated by Kosaraju's algorithm. This folder demonstrates each of the above three algorithms visually and contains a program that implements Kosaraju's Algorithm in Java as well.
